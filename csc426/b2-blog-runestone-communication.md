## Exploring Communication at Runestone

Before blogging, please do the following:

- Figure out how to join the Discord channel at Runestone Academy. Then join it. Spend 15 minutes exploring the various channels.
- Find the Google groups at Runestone Academy. I don't recommend joining these, but read several of the most recent posts in each of the Google groups.
- Identify what other ways Runestone Academy has to communicate virtually.

## Blog Prompt

In your next blog entry, address each of the following bullets (1 or more paragraph each):

- After hearing from Dr. Brad Miller, what are your first impressions about Runestone as an open-source project? Please explain.
- Discuss the Discord channels Runestone offers. How active do they seem? 
- Discuss the Google Groups, what they each do and how active they seem.
- Discuss the other forms of communication at Runestone. Why do you think they are offered?
- What excites you about contributing to Runestone (if anything)? Explain.
- What worries you about contributing to Runestone (if anything)? Explain.

### In order to receive credit for each blog entry, you must do *both* of the following:

- Post your entry to your blog.
- Additionally, copy and paste the text of your entry to Moodle. (This should only take a couple of minutes.)
  
The best blog entries will be honest, thoughtful, and critically reflective. Here are some [blog examples](blogreflection.md) of the differences
between reporting, reflection, and critical reflection.
  
### Please note that blog prompts are due by 8 am on their due dates --do not wait until the last minute!
