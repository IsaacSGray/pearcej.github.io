## Exploring Pretext

Before blogging, please do all of the following:

- Read [PreTeXt Overview](https://pretextbook.org/)
-Read [PreTeXt Philosophy](https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/philosophy.html)
- Read [PreTeXt Source](https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/introduction-to-source-formatting.html)
- Read [PreTeXt Source to Output](https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/start-source-to-output.html)
- Read [PreTeXt Images](https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/overview-images.html)
- Spend 30 minutes scimming and selectively reading whatever interests you in [PreTeXt Author Guide](https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/part-author.html), ignoring the chapter on Webwork and [Welcome to the Pretext Community](https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/welcome.html).

## Blog Prompt

In this blog entry, write a full blog post on your thoughts about Pretext around the length of a typical blog post that one might find on [Medium](https://medium.com/).  Be sure to include the following:
- What is the Pretext authoring language and the philosophy behind it?
- What are the advantages/disadvantages of Pretext as an authoring language?
- How does the PreTeXt community differ from other open source communities that you know? (Be sure to write for a broad audience, not just your classmates and instructor.)

### In order to receive credit for each blog entry, you must do *both* of the following:

- Post your entry to your blog.
- Additionally, copy and paste the text of your entry to Moodle. (This should only take a couple of minutes.)
  
The best blog entries will be honest, thoughtful, and critically reflective. Here are some [blog examples](blogreflection.md) of the differences
between reporting, reflection, and critical reflection.
  
### Please note that blog prompts are due by 8 am on their due dates --do not wait until the last minute!
