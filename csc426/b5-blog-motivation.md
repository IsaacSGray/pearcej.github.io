# Blog on Motivation

Read the following:
- [Intrinsic Motivation in Open Source Software Development](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/49926/1/668836490.pdf)

- [Why Hackers Do What They Do: Understanding Motivation and Effort in Free/Open Source Software Projects](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/15-352-managing-innovation-emerging-trends-spring-2005/8733c45a525ebcede867a9fb282398ca_lakhaniwolf.pdff)

In your blog entry, address each of the following bullets (1 or more paragraph each):
- Discuss the motivations developers have for writing for OSS that are explored in the readings. Compare and contrast your own motivations and traits with those explored in the readings.

- One of the readings states that "enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation, namely how creative a person feels when working on the project, is the strongest and most pervasive driver." Think of a time you did a big job or project solely based out of enjoyment. (Your example need not necessarily be in programming) Explain why you chose to tackle this job or project.

- Identify what you consider to be blockers in your life or career that sometimes hinder you or your motivation. Elaborate on what you might consider doing to overcome those blockers.

- Reflect on your experience contributing to PreTeXT books thus far. What has been your experience with intrinsic motivation? What has been your experience with extrinsic motivation? What has been your experience with overcoming blockers?

### Remember in order to receive credit for each blog entry, you must do *both* of the following:

- Post your entry to your blog.
- Additionally, copy and paste the text of your entry to Moodle.

The best blog entries will be honest, thoughtful, and critically reflective. Here are some [blog examples](blogreflection.md)
of the differences between reporting, reflection, and critical reflection.
